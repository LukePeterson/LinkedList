# Linked List

This repository contains some basic examples of how to implement linked lists in Go.

Linked lists are a fundamental data structure used to store a sequence of elements in a linear order. Unlike arrays or slices, linked lists are built from `nodes`, where each node contains a piece of data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertions and deletions as we don't need to rearrange the entire data structure, just the links between nodes.
